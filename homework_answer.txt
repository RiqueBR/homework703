1. Continent View is rendering more than once, it's actually rendering all the continents
and also sending the information to Continent list view, to which continent view is being rendered
there as well.

2. Continent view is nested within continent list view, to the extent that continent view is
dependent of the list view.

3. It allows views to keep under the single responsibility mode, helps with usability
and it is easier to manage pages.
